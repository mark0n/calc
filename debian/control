Conflicts: epics-synapps, epics-synapps-dev,
Description: Additional calculator record types
 Run-time expression evaluation, similar to calcPostfix,
 in base, but extended to handle strings,  arrays, and
 additional numeric operations. calc also contains the
 transform record, which supports multiple interdependent
 expressions; aSub-record-based array-interpolation support;
 and the swait record, which is similar to the calcout record,
 but it writes using ca_put_notify(), and thus can detect
 the completion of any processing it causes.
 .
 This package contains headers and libraries needed at build time.
